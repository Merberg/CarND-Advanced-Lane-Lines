# Advanced Lane Finding Project

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/571/view) Points

### Writeup, Notebooks, and Files

This Writeup serves as a guide to how my projects addresses the items called out in the Rubric.  The [AdvancedLaneFinding.ipynb](https://github.com/Merberg/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines/blob/master/AdvancedLaneFinding.ipynb) notebook houses the source to calibrate the camera and the pipeline used to detect the lane lines within images.  Peppered between functions are cells (noted as _Testing/Plotting Cell(s):_) that are inserted to test functionality.  Test images and found line result videos can be found in test_images and output_images respectively.

### Camera Calibration
The _Camera Calibration_ notebook cells perform the following functions:
1. Read in the images (RGB)
2. Convert to grayscale
3. Use the OpenCV **findChessboardCorners** to locate the 9x6 corners on the image
4. Store valid corners (imagePoints) and their corresponding world points (worldPoints)
5. Use the image and world points as parameters for the OpenCV **calibrateCamera**
6. Save the resulting camera matrix and distortion coefficients for use by the pipeline with the OpenCV **undistort** method.

This is an example of a calibration test image that has had its distortion corrected:

### Pipeline (single images)


#### 1. Distortion-corrected

The first step in the pipeline, the _Functions for undistortion_ section, uses the camera calibration matrix and the cv2.undistort() function to correct an image.  It produces the following results:
![Step 1 Distortion-Correction][image2]

#### 2. Binary Image Threshold Correction

The _Functions to create filtered binary images_ section provides many functions for performing binary image corrections, with its following testing section for visualizing the results.  Initially, [ThresholdTesting.ipynb](https://github.com/Merberg/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines/blob/master/ThresholdTesting.ipynb) was used to experiment with various Sobel threshold and colorspace techniques.  The final

#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you performed a perspective transform and provide an example of a transformed image.

The code for my perspective transform includes a function called `warper()`, which appears in lines 1 through 8 in the file `example.py` (output_images/examples/example.py) (or, for example, in the 3rd code cell of the IPython notebook).  The `warper()` function takes as inputs an image (`img`), as well as source (`src`) and destination (`dst`) points.  I chose the hardcode the source and destination points in the following manner:

```python
src = np.float32(
    [[(img_size[0] / 2) - 55, img_size[1] / 2 + 100],
    [((img_size[0] / 6) - 10), img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] * 5 / 6) + 60, img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] / 2 + 55), img_size[1] / 2 + 100]])
dst = np.float32(
    [[(img_size[0] / 4), 0],
    [(img_size[0] / 4), img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] * 3 / 4), img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] * 3 / 4), 0]])
```

This resulted in the following source and destination points:

| Source        | Destination   | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:| 
| 585, 460      | 320, 0        | 
| 203, 720      | 320, 720      |
| 1127, 720     | 960, 720      |
| 695, 460      | 960, 0        |

I verified that my perspective transform was working as expected by drawing the `src` and `dst` points onto a test image and its warped counterpart to verify that the lines appear parallel in the warped image.

#### 4. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you identified lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial?

Then I did some other stuff and fit my lane lines with a 2nd order polynomial kinda like this:

![alt text][image5]

#### 5. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you calculated the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.

I did this in lines # through # in my code in `my_other_file.py`

#### 6. Provide an example image of your result plotted back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.

I implemented this step in lines # through # in my code in `yet_another_file.py` in the function `map_lane()`.  Here is an example of my result on a test image:

### Pipeline (video)

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).

Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video.mp4)

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
